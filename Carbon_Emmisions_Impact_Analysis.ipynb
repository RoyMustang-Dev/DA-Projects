    "# Carbon Emissions Impact Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of our time, with rising carbon emissions playing a pivotal role in driving global temperature anomalies. Analyzing the relationship between CO₂ concentrations and temperature changes provides valuable insights into the underlying patterns and trends that shape our planet’s climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we aim to explore the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures. The focus will be on identifying historical trends, detecting anomalies, and simulating potential future scenarios to understand how changes in CO₂ concentrations influence temperature anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will work with two primary datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One containing annual temperature changes across multiple countries and decades,\n",
    "2. Another featuring monthly CO₂ concentrations measured globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these datasets, we will investigate correlations, detect patterns over decades, and use predictive modelling to simulate “what-if” scenarios. This data-driven approach will provide actionable insights into the connection between carbon emissions and climate change, which can offer valuable context for sustainable policy-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the dataset from [here!](https://statso.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-emissions.zip)"
